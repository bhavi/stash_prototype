  <h4>Stash Integration Prototype</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The purpose of the prototype is to be sure that the Stash user interface and the engines for presenting and working with a metadata schema integrate and work together in a useful way.  It is not a full featured prototype of all the metadata elements or all functionality such as login, full metadata editing, full submission into a repository, etc.  It is not intended to have a high-fidelity or full featured interface, but test the use of the application along with a prototype metadata engine.</p>
